        text: "After entering college, I got acquainted with computer science,consequently I came to know about programming. The foundation of my programming journey started with C programming language in which I wrote those first magical words every programmer writes when starting to code that is 'Hello World'. After getting a little proficiency in C programming language I started practicing questions at HackerRank, the foundational website for perhaps every other coder starting out there. After working with C programming language for a while I realized that it took a lot of time and effort to do things in C programming language so I searched for something better, that's when I got introduced to C++. I learnt C++ on my own and started programming in it and it was really great for solving problems with its vast availability of header files and especially the STL or Standard Template Library. After getting an intermediate proficiency in C++ I started competitive coding and also got introduced to Web Development."

Then, I came to  know about JavaScript and Typescript, these are used to make wonderful web-page animations in conjunction with CSS. I already have an intermediate level proficiency in most of these libraries and frameworks and have also built some projects with them on my own and also some with my team Code Mergers and one for the team Sadbhawna.
